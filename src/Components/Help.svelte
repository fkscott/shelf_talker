                <h6>If the info entry section is overlapping the preview...</h6>
                <p>I designed this tool around modern screen sizes (1280x720 and larger). If you make the window smaller clipping will occur.
                    To mitigate this issue, do <strong>Ctrl Minus</strong> or <strong>Cmd Minus</strong> to zoom out and the overlapping issue should go away.

                <h6>Making a Shelf Talker</h6>
                <p>Making a shelf talker is easy. Just start typing in the specifications of the wine and you will see the preview update on the left.
                    To switch between the Acclaim and Non-Acclaim template, just click their respective buttons at the top of the page.
                </p>
            
                <h6>Acclaim Template Options</h6>
            
                <p>For the acclaim template, you can select a source from the dropdown, or enter your own by selecting <em>Custom Source
                </em> from the dropdown menu and typing in the name of the source in <em>Custom Acclaim Source</em> box.</p>
            
                <p>You can also select different "Lifestyle" options (vegan, gluten free, biodynamic, etc.) from the dropdown below <em>Custom Acclaim Source</em></p>
            
                <h6>Downloading a Shelf Talker</h6>
            
                <p>Once you are happy with your design, just click the <em>Export Shelf Talker</em> button. A dialog will pop up notifying you that the shelf talker
                is ready for download. After that, you can click the <em>Download Shelf Talker</em> button for an image of your design.</p>
